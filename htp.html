            <p id="title">How To Play, Ball Battle</p>
            <p id="instructions">Ball Battle is a very simple game to play. You are the white ball in the middle trying to avoid all of the other balls that are larger than you. Yet the way to increase your score is to eat (run into) the other balls that are smaller than you. When you eat a ball the radius (size) of you cicle increases. But you must remember that as your ball gets bigger, the other balls will increase in their size as well. Another addition to the game is that when your score reaches a multiple of 50, (50,100,150 etc.) then your ball (and the other balls) will go back to their original starting size. As well as the speed of ALL balls will slightly increase making it more difficult. Don't worry though, you will keep your score, all that happens is the balls go back to the size they started as. Now you might be thinking, "that's kinda dumb." On the contrairy actually, if you ball never resets in size, then the other balls will keep getting bigger, and so will your ball. And eventually after you have reached a certain score, it will be impossible for you to continue without running into a ball that is larger than you. Therefore your would receive a game over, and that would just be unfair.
            <br/><br/>
            The only controls are your arrow keys. You will be able to use these key to move up(&uarr;), down(&darr;), right(&rarr;), and left(&larr;) across the screen. As well as holding right(&rarr;) and up(&uarr;), will make you go up and right at the same time, so diagonally this direction(&#8599;). This will work for all directions.<br/><br/>I would like to thank you so much for playing my game, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
